2. About
--------
ZDL is a frontend ("launcher") for ZDoom based Doom engine source ports. It
provides convenient interface to launch Doom engine games and their third-party
modifications (WADs) using selected source port. Launch configurations can be
saved on disc to be later used by ZDL to quickly launch selected game or
modification. ZDL can also be used to launch multiplayer sessions.
