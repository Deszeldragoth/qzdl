2. General
----------
ZDL is written in C++ and uses Qt 4.8 framework. To be able to compile ZDL you
should install Qt 4.8 SDK. ZDL also uses SimpleWFA and miniz libraries which
are statically linked and included with the sources. Sources can be downloaded
from official GitHub page:

	https://github.com/lcferrum/qzdl
	
After compiling, see README file for instructions on using ZDL.

3. Compile for Windows
----------------------
ZDL source code includes Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 solution that should be
used to compile ZDL on Windows. Besides VS 2010, to compile ZDL you need to
install:

    1) Qt 4.8 for Microsoft Visual Studio 2010

    2) Qt Visual Studio Add-in
	
Note that you can also use versions of VS greater than 2010 (there is a
backward compatibility with solutions from previous versions), but official VS
Qt 4.8 distributions support only 2008 and 2010 versions. Also, official VS
Qt 4.8 distributions support only x86 architecture. For versions of VS greater
than 2010 or for x86-64 architecture, Qt 4.8 should be compiled from the
sources. Official VS 2010 distribution of Qt 4.8 is compiled for dynamic
linking. If you want ZDL to be compiled as standalone executable, you have to
recompile Qt with static linking support and select 'Release (Static)'
configuration in VS solution. After setting up build environment and selecting
proper build configuration, don't forget to set correct VS solution Qt version.

Also note that there is a Qt Creator project distributed with ZDL sources, but
it's not intended to be used to compile ZDL on Windows. Though it can be used
in such role after some modifications to the source code and project itself.

4. Compile for Linux
--------------------
ZDL source code includes Qt Creator project that should be used to compile ZDL
on Linux. Project is optimized for GNU C++ compiler, other compilers may 
require some modifications to be made. Besides C++ compiler, to compile ZDL you
need to install:

    1) Qt 4.8 toolchain

    2) Qt Creator
	
All these should be readily available for your selected Linux distro via it's
package manager. Actual package names of needed components differ between Linux
distros. If your Linux distro provides only generic "Qt 4" toolchain package(s),
make sure that it is 4.8 version of Qt toolchain. If not, Qt 4.8 should be
compiled from the sources. Usually, Qt toolchain provided via package manager
supports only dynamic linking. If you want ZDL to be compiled as standalone
executable, you have to recompile Qt with static linking support and supply
'CONFIG+=static' as additional argument to qmake in Qt Creator build settings
for ZDL project.
