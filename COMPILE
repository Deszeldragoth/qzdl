2. General
----------
ZDL is written in C++ and uses Qt library. To be able to compile ZDL you should
install Qt SDK. ZDL also uses SimpleWFA and miniz libraries which are
statically linked and included with the sources. Sources can be downloaded from
official GitHub page:

	https://github.com/lcferrum/qzdl
	
After compiling, see README file for instructions on using ZDL.

3. Compile for Windows
----------------------
ZDL source code is distributed in the form of Microsoft Visual Studio 2010
solution and uses Qt 4.8. Besides VS 2010, to compile ZDL you need to download:

    1) Qt 4.8 for Microsoft Visual Studio 2010

    2) Qt Visual Studio Add-in
	
Default distribution of Qt 4.8 is compiled for dynamic linking. If you want ZDL
to be compiled as standalone executable, you have to recompile Qt with static
linking support. After setting up build environment, don't forget to set
correct Qt version in Qt project settings.
